# Browser Hash - Browser Identifier

Browser Hash is a powerful tool designed to address the need for client machine identification using browser-specific information. It generates a unique ID (hash) that identifies the browser, even when used in an incognito tab or through a VPN, although it may have certain limitations in specific scenarios.

## How It Works

Browser Hash collects a wide range of static and dynamic information from the browser and the device it's running on. This information includes details about the browser, operating system, hardware, and available resources. The careful combination of this information is used to generate a unique hash, effectively creating a "fingerprint" of the browser.

## Captured Information

Browser Hash captures a variety of information, including:

- Browser details (name, version, manufacturer, etc.)
- Device information (screen resolution, CPU cores, color depth, etc.)
- GPU details (device name and vendor, WebGL version)
- Mobile device information (model, manufacturer, operating system, browser version, screen resolution)
- HTML version
- User agent (with and without masking)
- TLS/SSL compatibility
- Support for features like WebSockets, Service Workers, WebRTC, Web Workers, etc.
- Platform details (platform, operating system version, etc.)
- List of installed fonts on the device
- Presence of DOM blockers
- Font preferences
- Audio support
- Monitor refresh rate
- Canvas usage
- CPU and operating system information
- User's preferred languages
- Screen size, device memory, and other hardware details
- Timezone
- Local storage support (sessionStorage, localStorage, indexedDB, openDatabase)
- CPU classes
- Browser plugins
- Touch device support
- Vendor and flavors
- Color settings (color depth, gamut support, inverted colors, etc.)
- Accessibility feature support (forced colors, monochrome, reduced motion, etc.)
- Mathematical and PDF feature support
- Architecture and payment-related features (Apple Pay)
- Privacy-related features (Private Click Measurement)
- WebGL extensions and features

## Usage

To implement Browser Hash:

1. Include the provided code in your project.
2. Make sure the code is loaded in a web browser environment (it won't work outside of a web browser).
3. Run the code and capture the generated hash.
4. The resulting hash can be used as a browser "fingerprint" for identification purposes.

**Important:** Remember that the accuracy and stability of identification may vary across browsers, devices, and usage scenarios. Browser Hash is not 100% foolproof and may have limitations in certain situations.
